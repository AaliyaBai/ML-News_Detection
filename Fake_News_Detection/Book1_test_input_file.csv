"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin supervised his intelligence agenciesâ€™ hacking of the U.S. presidential election and turned it from a general attempt to discredit American democracy to an effort to help Donald Trump, three U.S. officials said on Thursday. U.S. intelligence agenciesâ€™ conclusion that Russia tried to influence the election by hacking people and institutions, including Democratic Party bodies, has angered President-elect Trump, who says he won the Nov. 8 vote fairly. Russian officials have denied accusations of interference in the U.S. election. Separately, a senior White House official said on Thursday that Putin was likely to have been aware of the cyber attacks but he fell short of accusing the Russian president.       â€œI donâ€™t think things happen in the Russian government of this consequence without Vladimir Putin knowing about it,â€ Ben Rhodes, the White Houseâ€™s deputy national security adviser, told MSNBC. â€œWhen youâ€™re talking about a significant cyber intrusion like this, weâ€™re talking about the highest levels of government.â€ The U.S. officials - who have knowledge of intelligence information on the matter - said on the condition of anonymity that the hacking of U.S. political groups and figures had a more general focus at first. â€œThis began merely as an effort to show that American democracy is no more credible than Putinâ€™s version is,â€ one of the officials said. â€œIt gradually evolved from that to publicizing (Hillary) Clintonâ€™s shortcomings and ignoring the products of hacking Republican institutions, which the Russians also did,â€ the official said. By the fall, the official said, it became an effort to help Trumpâ€™s campaign because â€œPutin believed he would be much friendlier to Russia, especially on the matter of economic sanctionsâ€ than Democratic rival Clinton. Democratic President Barack Obama said in an interview with National Public Radio that the United States will take action against Russia. â€œI think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections ... we need to take action and we will,â€ he said according to excerpts of the Thursday interview released by NPR. â€œAt a time and a place of our own choosing. Some of it may be ... explicit and publicized; some of it may not be. ... Mr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this, because I spoke to him directly about it,â€ Obama said. NBC reported earlier that U.S. intelligence officials have â€œa high level of confidenceâ€ Putin was personally involved in the Russian cyber campaign against the United States. Hacked emails of Democratic operatives and Clinton aides were leaked during the presidential campaign, and at times dominated the news agenda. The U.S. officials said Russia also hacked Republicans but did little to nothing with the information they found.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told state TV channel Rossiya-24 that he was â€œdumbstruckâ€ by the NBC report of Putinâ€™s alleged involvement. â€œI think this is just silly, and the futility of the attempt to convince somebody of this is absolutely obvious,â€ he said. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has brushed off reports of Russian hacking of U.S. political institutions.         â€œIf Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?â€ Trump wrote in a post on Twitter on Thursday. In fact, the U.S. government did formally accuse Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against U.S. political organizations in October - one month ahead of the election. Obama last week ordered a review by the U.S. intelligence agencies about foreign interference in the 2016 election. Asked on Thursday about the hacks, Secretary of State John Kerry described how Obama had been considering the evidence ahead of the October announcement. â€œThe president made the decision based on the input that was carefully, carefully vetted by the intelligence community ... that he did have an obligation to go out to the country and give a warning. And he did so,â€ Kerry said at a news briefing.              The three U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters said the fact that Putin oversaw a hacking operation was not surprising and is standard operating procedure in Russia. â€œIf anything, given his background as a KGB officer, Putin has a much tighter grip on all Russian intelligence operations, civilian and military, foreign and domestic, than any democratic leader does,â€ one official said. The reports of Russian hacking have raised concerns among both political parties in Congress, with top Republicans breaking with Trump to call for closer scrutiny. Some Republican lawmakers have also questioned Trumpâ€™s pick for Secretary of State, Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, who has close business ties to the Russian government. ",1
"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Friday that the United States should either prove accusations that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic Party organizations or drop the issue. â€œEither stop talking about it or finally provide some evidence. Otherwise it looks indecent,â€ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Tokyo. Russia has repeatedly denied the hacking allegations.  ",0
"HERSHEY, Pa. (Reuters) - Ready for another Donald Trump presidential campaign? President-elect Trump, who begins his first White House term on Jan. 20, tossed out the idea of seeking re-election during a â€œthank youâ€ rally held to express his appreciation to voters in states that were crucial to his Nov. 8 victory. Trump won Pennsylvania by little more than 44,000 votes over Democrat Hillary Clinton. It was the first time a Republican candidate had won the state since 1988. â€œAnd in four years, weâ€™re going to win it by even more,â€ the 70-year-old New Yorker said in an arena in Hershey, Pennsylvania, joined by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Trumpâ€™s â€œthank youâ€ tour continues with an event in Orlando,  Florida, on Friday and then is to conclude in Mobile, Alabama, on Saturday. During the tour, Trump has vowed to press on with some key campaign pledges, like building a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico and suspending immigration from violent countries like Syria. In Hershey, Trump noted he had won the state of Ohio but that it would have been better if he had had the support of Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich, who fought against Trump in the Republican presidential primary. â€œBut you know what? Heâ€™s called,â€ Trump said of Kasich. â€œIt would have been nice if he had called a couple weeks earlier. But heâ€™s called. Heâ€™s been very nice.â€ Trump drew boos by praising the cooperation he has been getting from Democratic President Barack Obama. The two have had regular telephone conversations to discuss the transition of power. â€œNo, no, no,â€ Trump told the crowd to tamp down their boos. But then he criticized Obamaâ€™s press secretary, Josh Earnest, who has expressed some skepticism about Trumpâ€™s positions in his daily briefings. â€œBut this foolish guy, Josh Earnest. I donâ€™t know if heâ€™s even talking to President Obama,â€ he said. Trump, who is to pick his own choice for press secretary soon, added, â€œYou know, having the right press secretary is so important.â€ ",0
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc YHOO.O came under renewed scrutiny by federal investigators and lawmakers on Thursday after disclosing the largest known data breach in history, prompting Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) to demand better terms for its planned purchase of Yahooâ€™s internet business. Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September. Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahooâ€™s core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for â€œmajor concessionsâ€ in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation. Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: â€œWe are confident in Yahooâ€™s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.â€ Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after Septemberâ€™s breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would â€œreview the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusionsâ€ about whether to proceed.  The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday.  Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement.  Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the dealâ€™s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michiganâ€™s Ross School of Business.  A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested. Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41.  Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record.  It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The company added that some of its partners were affected. One such partner, Europeâ€™s Sky Plc (SKYB.L), said Yahoo provides email services to its 2.1 million Sky.com email account holders, but it was unclear how many of those accounts were affected.  The announcement followed Yahooâ€™s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers.  The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahooâ€™s cyber security practices. â€œThis most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,â€ he said in a statement. Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as â€œdeeply troubling.â€  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breachâ€™s circumstances and the companyâ€™s disclosures to law enforcement.  Germanyâ€™s cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect usersâ€™ personal data. â€œConsidering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,â€ BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement. The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts. â€œYahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,â€ Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email.  A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the companyâ€™s security measures, said on Thursday: â€œWeâ€™re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.â€  ",0
"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Friday that President Vladimir Putin had given President Barack Obama â€œa really clear responseâ€ to U.S. allegations that Moscow had interfered in the U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic Party organizations. Russiaâ€™s TASS news agency cited Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov as telling reporters in Tokyo that Putin had explained Russiaâ€™s stance on the issue to Obama on the sidelines of the G20 summit in September. â€œThere was a tete-a-tete conversation and different themes were discussed,â€ Ushakov was cited as saying. â€œThis theme was touched upon.  A really clear reply was given by our side which perhaps did not fit with what Obama was trying to explain to us.â€ Three U.S. officials said on Thursday that Putin had supervised his intelligence agenciesâ€™ hacking of the U.S. presidential election and turned it from a general attempt to discredit American democracy to an effort to help Donald Trump.
