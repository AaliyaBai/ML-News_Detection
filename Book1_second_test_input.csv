"(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has formally named Republican Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, a former Navy SEAL commander, as his pick for interior secretary, the Trump transition team said in a statement on Thursday. The following is a list of Republican Trumpâ€™s selections for top jobs in his administration; all the posts but those of national security adviser, the White House chief of staff, White House director of the National Economic Council and White House strategist require Senate confirmation: Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trumpâ€™s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. Son of a country store owner, the Alabama senator and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  U.S. Representative Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. governmentâ€™s sweeping collection of Americansâ€™ communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.     Ross, 79, heads the private equity firm W.L. Ross & Co. His net worth was pegged by Forbes at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump and an economic adviser, Ross helped shape the Trump campaignâ€™s views on trade policy. He blames the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which went into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization, for causing massive U.S. factory job losses.     Mattis is a retired Marine general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname â€œMad Dog.â€ He was once rebuked for saying in 2005: â€œItâ€™s fun to shoot some people.â€ DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools. Perry, 66, adds to the list of oil drilling advocates skeptical about climate change who have been picked for senior positions in Trumpâ€™s Cabinet. The selections have worried environmentalists but cheered an oil and gas industry eager for expansion. Perry, who also briefly ran in the 2016 presidential race, would have to be confirmed by the Senate to head the Energy Department, which is responsible for U.S. energy policy and oversees the nationâ€™s nuclear weapons program.  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ADMINISTRATOR: SCOTT PRUITT An ardent opponent of President Barack Obamaâ€™s measures to stem climate change, Oklahoma Attorney General Pruitt, 48, has enraged environmental activists. But he fits with the president-electâ€™s promise to cut the agency back and eliminate regulation that he says is stifling oil and gas drilling. Pruitt became the top state prosecutor for Oklahoma, which has extensive oil reserves, in 2011, and has challenged the EPA multiple times since. U.S. Representative Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion. The final leadership role of Kellyâ€™s 45-year career was head of the U.S. Southern Command, responsible for U.S. military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean. The 66-year-old retired Marine general differed with Obama on key issues and has warned of vulnerabilities along the United Statesâ€™ southern border with Mexico. Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson previously indicated reluctance to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. Carson is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump. Zinke, 55, a first-term Republican representative and a member of the House subcommittee on natural resources, has voted for legislation that would weaken environmental safeguards on public lands. He has taken stances favoring coal, a fossil fuel that suffered during the Obama administration. The League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave Zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent. Puzder, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc [APOLOT.UL], which runs the Carlâ€™s Jr. and Hardeeâ€™s fast-food chains, has been a vociferous critic of government regulation of the workplace and the National Labor Relations Board. Puzder, 66, has argued that higher minimum wages would hurt workers by forcing restaurants to close, and praises the benefits of automation, so his appointment is likely to antagonize organized labor.  Cohn, 56, president and chief operating officer of investment bank Goldman Sachs, had widely been considered heir apparent to Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of the Wall Street firm. Trump hammered Goldman and Blankfein during the presidential campaign, releasing a television ad that called Blankfein part of a â€œglobal power structureâ€ that had robbed Americaâ€™s working class. Retired Lieutenant General Flynn, 57, was an early Trump supporter and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his Army career in 1981 and was deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obamaâ€™s foreign policy. Tillerson, 64, has spent his entire career at Exxon Mobil Corp, where he rose to serve as its chairman and CEO in 2006. A civil engineer by training, the Texan joined the worldâ€™s largest energy company in 1975 and led several of its operations in the United States as well as in Yemen, Thailand and Russia. As Exxonâ€™s chief executive, he maintained close ties with Moscow and opposed U.S. sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Crimea. McMahon, 68, is a co-founder and former chief executive of the professional wrestling franchise WWE, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut. She ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for a U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012, and was an early supporter of Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. She is a director at Ingersoll Rand, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Company. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. Mnuchin, 53, is a successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern Californiaâ€™s largest bank. Housing advocacy groups criticized the bank for its foreclosure practices, accusing it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Haley, 44, has been the Republican governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, she led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. Recently re-elected to serve as Republican National Committee chairman, Priebus will give up his party post to join Trump in the White House, where the low-key Washington operative could help forge ties with Congress to advance Trumpâ€™s agenda. The 44-year-old was a steadfast supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign even as the party fractured amid the choice. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST, SENIOR COUNSELOR: STEVE BANNON The former head of the conservative website Breitbart News came aboard as Trumpâ€™s campaign chairman in August. A rabble-rousing conservative media figure, he helped shift Breitbart into a forum for the alt-right, a loose confederation of those who reject mainstream politics and includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. His hiring signals Trumpâ€™s dedication to operating outside the norms of Washington. As White House chief of staff, Bannon, 63, will serve as Trumpâ€™s gatekeeper and agenda-setter. ",0
"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s plan to punish a U.S. automaker accused of price-fixing is a sign of how Beijing could retaliate if President-elect Donald Trump upends decades of relations between the two nations. Trumpâ€™s assertion that the United States need not be bound by the policy that Taiwan is part of â€œone Chinaâ€ would erode a bedrock of U.S.-China ties that has underpinned the vast increase in trade and cooperation between what are now the worldâ€™s two largest economies. Few expect the disagreement will lead to outright military confrontation, nor even the kind of economic war that many feared could be launched by Trumpâ€™s threat during the U.S. presidential campaign to slap tariffs of up to 45 percent on Chinese imports. However, a rising China has plenty of other ways to push back hard if Trump presses on the Taiwan question, which most analysts see as the most sensitive part of the U.S.-China relationship. In what might be a shot across the bow of the Trump administration, due to take office on Jan. 20, the official China Daily newspaper quoted a state planning official saying China will soon penalize an unnamed U.S. automaker for monopolistic behavior. While the official said no one should read â€œanything improperâ€ into this, shares of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co skidded. Auto industry sources have told Reuters this specific investigation was already underway before Trumpâ€™s recent comments. However, the manner in which it was announced, by saying only that it was a U.S. automaker before a formal announcement of fines, has raised questions around whether officials might be seizing on the case to send a shot across the bow of the incoming Trump administration. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, said on Wednesday Trumpâ€™s team was aware of the report but it would be premature to comment. In Washington, a Democratic congressional aide said Chinaâ€™s threat to fine the automaker was a â€œgood sharp reminderâ€ to Trump that â€œthey have cards to play too and that if he is thinking that he can enter into negotiations - be it on Taiwan, trade, North Korea, whatever - as if the United States is the sole global superpower ... then he is going to need to think again.â€ Chinaâ€™s state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, did not responded to Reuters requests for comment on the China Daily story. Chinaâ€™s Foreign Ministry said it did not know any details about the case. â€œChina welcomes foreign companies, including American ones, to invest in and operate in China. At the same time they must respect Chinaâ€™s laws and rules. This point is very clear,â€ ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said when asked if this was China sending a message to Trump.  Pressure on other U.S. companies, such as Boeing Co (BA.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N), with large interests in China could be one of the most tangible tools of retaliation, together with new limits on access to the countryâ€™s huge markets. U.S. business interests in China are estimated at more than $500 billion. Wider economic steps - such as China, Americaâ€™s biggest creditor, selling a significant part of its $1.16 trillion of U.S. Treasuries, or weakening its currency - seem unlikely, the first because it would slash the value of Chinaâ€™s U.S. bond portfolio and the second because it could accelerate capital flight, experts said. Beijing could speed up a military build-up that had begun to slow along with Chinese economic growth, carry out naval exercises close to Taiwan - which it regards as a renegade province - and withhold diplomatic cooperation on issues such as Iran and North Koreaâ€™s nuclear programs. â€œTaiwan policy is what China considers a core interest ... and itâ€™s prepared to go to great lengths to defend it,â€ said Eric Altbach, senior vice president at the Albright Stonebridge Group consultancy in Washington and a former deputy assistant U.S. trade representative for China affairs. The consensus within the Obama administration is that Trump, who irked China by taking a phone call from Taiwanâ€™s president, was not fully aware of the potential backlash from Beijing over his questioning of the â€œone Chinaâ€ policy, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The hope is that by the time Trump takes over from President Barack Obama, he will recognize that China has advanced so far economically, diplomatically and militarily that it is unwise to pick fights with Beijing over such a bedrock principle, he added. A former senior U.S. official took a more pessimistic view. â€œTrump has basically guaranteed that the first year in the China relationship willÂ be a combative, competitive one, and the question is how bad it will get,â€ he said. â€œThe Chinese now are basically putting together their list on how to retaliate.â€ There are at least three ways in which the matter could play out, U.S. China experts said. Trump could backtrack over time, much as former U.S. President George W. Bush did. A second track would be if Trump goes on questioning the â€œone Chinaâ€ policy without taking concrete action. The third,  considered unlikely by U.S. officials past and present, would be a drift toward military confrontation. Asked if Trumpâ€™s â€œone Chinaâ€ stance could lead to this, a source with ties to the Chinese leadership told Reuters: â€œWe will see what Trump says and does after he becomes president.â€ A second source with leadership ties said they expected tensions with the United States over Taiwan. But the source said Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has sounded a more nationalistic line than his recent predecessors, could also use the issue to further cement his grip on power. â€œIf (Taiwan) is emboldened by the U.S. support and does something drastic, it could be an opportunity for us. There will be just cause to dispatch troops,â€ the second source said. While the possibility of Taiwan declaring independence and hence triggering a Chinese invasion seems low, the mere softening in the U.S. commitment to the policy would likely play out in Chinaâ€™s defense posture. â€œIt will alter Chinese defense priorities. I think thatâ€™s inevitable now,â€ said Dennis Wilder, a former CIA China analyst. He said Xi may increase Chinese military spending for 2017 and place new emphasis, over time, on gaining the amphibious capabilities necessary to actually invade Taiwan. â€œXi Jinping has to respond to this internally, domestically, and while he doesnâ€™t want an open fight with Trump, he will have to show ... resolve,â€ he said, citing higher military spending, more defense exercises and tougher rhetoric on Taiwan. â€œWe can anticipate that unless this issue is taken off the table.â€ ",1
"(Reuters) - Yahoo Incâ€™s shares fell as much as 3.8 percent on Thursday, a day after the company said that more than 1 billion user accounts were compromised in a security breach in August 2013. The number of users affected by the breach, the largest in history, was double the number implicated in a prior 2014 breach that Yahoo had disclosed in September. Verizon, which has agreed to buy Yahooâ€™s core Internet business for $4.83 billion, had said at the time that it might withdraw from the deal. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier said on Wednesday that it would review the impact of the latest development. â€œThe prior breaches were not seen to have an effect on the Verizon deal, so I would say that this is not going to have an effect either because its just something that is understood, it has to be addressed,â€ Tigress Financial Partner analyst Ivan Feinseth said. Up to Wednesdayâ€™s close, Yahooâ€™s stock had fallen more than 7 percent since the first breach was announced in September. ",0
"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The United States is ready to confront China should it continue its overreaching maritime claims in the South China Sea, the head of the U.S. Pacific fleet said on Wednesday, comments that threaten to escalate tensions between the two global rivals. China claims most of the resource-rich South China Sea through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims. The United States has called on China to respect the findings of the arbitration court in The Hague earlier this year which invalidated its vast territorial claims in the strategic waterway. But Beijing continues to act in an â€œaggressiveâ€ manner, to which the United States stands ready to respond, Admiral Harry Harris, head of the U.S. Pacific Command, said in a speech in Sydney. â€œWe will not allow a shared domain to be closed down unilaterally no matter how many bases are built on artificial features in the South China Sea,â€ he said. â€œWe will cooperate when we can but we will be ready to confront when we must.â€ The comments threaten to stoke tensions between the United States and China, already heightened by President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to accept a telephone call from Taiwanâ€™s president on Dec. 2 that prompted a diplomatic protest from Beijing. Asked about Harrisâ€™s remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the situation in the South China Sea was currently stable, thanks to the hard work of China and others in the region. â€œWe hope the United States can abide by its promises on not taking sides on the sovereignty dispute in the South China Sea, respect the efforts of countries in the region to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea region and do more to promote peace and stability there,â€ he told a daily news briefing. The United States estimates Beijing has added more than 3,200 acres (1,300 hectares) of land on seven features in the South China Sea over the past three years, building runways, ports, aircraft hangars and communications equipment. In response, the United States has conducted a series of freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, the latest of which came in October. The patrols have angered Beijing, with a senior Chinese official in July warning the practice may end in â€œdisasterâ€. Harris said it was a decision for the Australian government whether the U.S. ally should undertake its own freedom-of-navigation operations, but said the United States would continue with the practice.     â€œThe U.S. fought its first war following our independence to ensure freedom of navigation,â€ said Harris. â€œThis is an enduring principle and one of the reasons our forces stand ready to fight tonight.â€ ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a veiled warning to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Chinaâ€™s ambassador to the United States said on Wednesday that Beijing would never bargain with Washington over issues involving its national sovereignty or territorial integrity. Ambassador Cui Tiankai, speaking to executives of top U.S. companies, said China and the United States needed to work to strengthen their relationship.    â€œThe political foundation of China-U.S. relations should not be undermined. It should be preserved,â€ Cui said. â€œAnd basic norms of international relations should be observed, not ignored, certainly not be seen as something you can trade off,â€ he said. â€œAnd indeed, national sovereignty and territorial integrity are not bargaining chips. Absolutely not. I hope everybody would understand that.â€ He did not specifically mention Taiwan, or Trumpâ€™s comments last weekend that the United States did not necessarily have to stick to its nearly four-decade policy of recognizing that Taiwan is part of â€œone China.â€ Cuiâ€™s remarks were in line with recent protests from Chinaâ€™s Foreign Ministry, which regards the â€œone Chinaâ€ principle as the â€œpolitical basisâ€ for U.S.-China ties.. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. China considers Taiwan independence a red line issue. On Thursday, Chinaâ€™s influential state-run tabloid the Global Times said China needed to take the lead in deciding the islandâ€™s future. â€œIt is hoped that peace in the Taiwan Straits wonâ€™t be disrupted. But the Chinese mainland should display its resolution to recover Taiwan by force. Peace does not belong to cowards,â€ it said in an editorial. Trump, in an interview on â€œFox News Sunday,â€ suggested that the U.S. position on Taiwan could become part of his pledge to negotiate more favorable trade terms with China. â€œI fully understand the â€˜one Chinaâ€™ policy, but I donâ€™t know why we have to be bound by a â€˜one Chinaâ€™ policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,â€ Trump said. Trumpâ€™s comments came after he prompted a diplomatic protest from China over his decision to accept a telephone call from Taiwanâ€™s president on Dec. 2. U.S. corporate executives are increasingly pessimistic about their business prospects in China in light of tough restrictions on foreign investment in the countryâ€™s vast service sector, new cyber-security regulations that favor domestic technologies and weak enforcement of intellectual property protections. Earlier on Wednesday, news that Chinese officials may penalize a U.S. automaker for monopolistic pricing behavior pushed down shares of General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N).  Cui did not mention the autos case, but said: â€œChina will ensure that there is a level playing field, for all companies, in China, both domestic and foreign.â€ ",0
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China defended its right on Thursday to put â€œnecessary military installationsâ€ on artificial islands in the South China Sea, after a U.S. think-tank said Beijing appeared to have deployed weapons such as anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems. The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said its findings, made available first to Reuters on Wednesday, were based on analysis of satellite images of islands in the strategic trade route, where territory is claimed by several countries. The United States has previously criticized what it called Chinaâ€™s militarization of its maritime outposts, and stressed the need for freedom of navigation by conducting periodic air and naval patrols near them that have angered Beijing. Chinaâ€™s Defence Ministry said in a statement on its website on Thursday that the construction it had carried out on islands and reefs in the disputed Spratlys chain was â€œmainly for civilian useâ€. â€œAs for necessary military installations, they are mainly for defence and self-protection and are legitimate and lawful,â€ it said. â€œIf someone makes a show of force at your front door, would you not ready your slingshot?â€ The United States has conducted four freedom of navigation patrols, seen as a challenge to Chinaâ€™s extensive territorial claims in the South China Sea, in the past year or so, most recently in October. AMTI said satellite images of islands China has built in the Spratlys showed what appeared to be anti-aircraft guns and what were likely to be close-in weapons systems (CIWS) to protect against cruise missile strikes. Other images showed towers that likely contained targeting radar, it said. Beijing regards the islands as its sovereign territory, and has often said it is entitled to limited and necessary defensive installations. AMTI director Greg Poling said the think-tank had spent months trying to figure out the purposes of the structures shown in the images. â€œThis is the first time that weâ€™re confident in saying they are anti-aircraft and CIWS emplacements. We did not know that they had systems this big and this advanced there,â€ he told Reuters.  â€œThis is militarization. The Chinese can argue that itâ€™s only for defensive purposes, but if you are building giant anti-aircraft gun and CIWS emplacements, it means that you are prepping for a future conflict.â€ Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing in Beijing that he â€œdid not understandâ€ the situation referred to in the AMTI report. â€œThe Nansha islands are Chinaâ€™s inherent territory. Chinaâ€™s building of facilities and necessary territorial defensive  facilities on its own territory is completely normal,â€ he said, using Chinaâ€™s name for the Spratlys. â€œIf Chinaâ€™s building of normal facilities and deploying necessary territorial defensive facilities on its own islands is considered militarization, then what is the sailing of fleets into the South China Sea?â€ The Philippines, one of several countries with competing territorial claims in the South China Sea, said it was still verifying the report. â€œBut if true it is a big concern for us and the international community who use the South China Sea lanes for trade,â€ said Defence Minister Delfin Lorenzana. â€œIt would mean that the Chinese are militarising the area which is not good.â€ Lorenzanaâ€™s comments were made during a visit to Singapore with President Rodrigo Duterte, where he also said the United States had agreed to sell the Philippine Navy two advanced radar systems to boost its surveillance capability in the South China Sea. Australia too voiced concerns about Chinaâ€™s actions in the disputed waterway. â€œThe building of artificial islands and the possible militarization is creating an environment of tension and mistrust between claimants and other regional states,â€ said Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in a statement. â€œWe urge claimants to refrain from coercive behavior and unilateral actions designed to change the status quo in disputed areas.â€ U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has criticized Chinese behavior in the South China Sea, while signaling he may adopt a tougher approach to Chinaâ€™s assertive behavior in the region than President Barack Obama. The State Department said it would not comment on intelligence matters, but spokesman John Kirby added: â€œWe consistently call on China as well as other claimants to commit to peacefully managing and resolving disputes, to refrain from further land reclamation and construction of new facilities and the militarization of disputed features.â€ ",1
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has shut down or â€œdealt withâ€ thousands of websites for sharing â€œharmfulâ€ erotic or obscene content since April, the stateâ€™s office for combating pornography and illegal publications announced on Thursday. The office said 2,500 websites were prosecuted or shut down and more than 3 million â€œharmfulâ€ posts were deleted in eight months up to December during a drive to â€œpurifyâ€ the internet in China and protect youth, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The government has tightening its grip on Chinese cyberspace in recent months, in particular placing new restrictions on the fast-growing live-streaming industry. The state has a zero-tolerance approach to what it considers lewd, smutty or illegal content and has in past crackdowns removed tens of thousands of websites in a single year. Two popular news websites were also punished for spreading â€œillegalâ€ content, Xinhua reported. It did not elaborate. Aside from live-streaming, the office worked alongside the Ministry of Public Security, the ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Cyberspace Administration of China to target cloud storage, chat apps and â€œvulgarâ€ videos. Social media platforms have become a key tool for spreading illegal content and mobile pay platforms including Alipay and WeChat pay have allowed individuals to make big profits, the office said. ",1
"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China warned on Wednesday that any interference with or damage to the â€œone Chinaâ€ principle would have a serious impact on peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, as Taiwan said maintaining peace was in everyoneâ€™s interest. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday the United States did not necessarily have to stick to its long-standing position that Taiwan is part of â€œone Chinaâ€, further upsetting China which was already angered by Trumpâ€™s earlier telephone call with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. The issue is highly sensitive for China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, and Beijing expressed â€œserious concernâ€ about Trumpâ€™s remarks. An Fengshan, a spokesman for Chinaâ€™s Taiwan Affairs Office, told a regular news conference the Taiwan issue was about Chinaâ€™s sovereignty and territorial integrity. â€œUpholding the â€˜one Chinaâ€™ principle is the political basis of developing China-U.S. relations, and is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,â€ he said. â€œIf this basis is interfered with or damaged then the healthy, stable development of China-U.S. relations is out of the question, and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait will be seriously impacted,â€ An said. Taiwanâ€™s policy-making Mainland Affairs Council said  peaceful relations were a mutual responsibility across both sides of the Taiwan Strait.    â€œTaiwan has repeatedly stressed that maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the region is in the best interests of all parties,â€ said council spokesman Chiu Chui-cheng.  â€œTaiwan places equal weight on the development of Taiwan-U.S. relations and cross-strait relations.â€   China is deeply suspicious of Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party, believing they want to push for the islandâ€™s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. China has repeatedly warned that hard-won peace and stability across the narrow strait that separates them could be affected by any moves toward independence. â€œI think the facts tell these people that Taiwan independence is a dead end,â€ An said. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and some state media have suggested after Trumpâ€™s remarks that a military solution may now be needed. A senior U.S. defense official said on Tuesday Taiwanâ€™s defense spending had not kept pace with the threat posed by China and should be increased. Taiwanâ€™s annual defense spending has not hit 3 percent of its gross domestic product in recent years, which some military and political experts in Taiwan have said should be a minimum level.  â€œTaiwanâ€™s defense spending factors in external threats and the nationâ€™s annual budget,â€ Taiwan defense ministry spokesman Chen Chung-chi told Reuters.  â€œOur premier has said previously that the cabinet can look to use a special budget to meet defense needs in an emergency situation.â€In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the United States needed to handle the Taiwan issue cautiously to avoid ties with China receiving unnecessary interference. â€œAs for the so-called issue of Taiwan being threatened, I think weâ€™ve said many times that we oppose the United States and Taiwan having any form of official contacts or military relations,â€ Geng told a daily news briefing.
